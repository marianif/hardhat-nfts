# Hardhat NFTs

This program allows us to create 3 different types of NFTs

1. a Basic NFT
2. IPFS Hosted NFT ( NFT hosted off-chain ) that uses randomness to generate a unique NFT

- Pros: cheaper solution
- Cons: Someone needs to pin your data ( storage may not be that decentralized as ou wish )

3. SVG NFT ( Hosted 100% on-chain ) that uses price feed to be dynamic.

- Pros: the data is on chain
- Cons: MUCH more expensive

Finally the NFTs are deployed on Goerli Testnet and Opensea NFT marketplace
